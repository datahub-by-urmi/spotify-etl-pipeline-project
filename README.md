# Spotify End to End Data Engineering Project
In this project, we will create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline on AWS that leverages the Spotify API. The pipeline will extract data from Spotify, transform it into the required format, and store it within an AWS data repository.

### Introduction
This is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) project leveraging the Spotify API and AWS. The pipeline is designed to retrieve raw data, apply transformations, and load the final, useful results into an AWS data store.
